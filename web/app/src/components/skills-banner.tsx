/**
 * Promotes `open-mercato/skills` once (#391) — cezar's built-in default skills source
 * (`DEFAULT_SKILLS_REPOS` in `src/config.ts`) that today only surfaces in `--help`
 * (see `src/skills-banner.ts` for the CLI-side counterpart).
 *
 * "Shown once" is persisted server-side in `ui-state.json`, not a cookie — the house pattern
 * (`AppearanceProvider`, `RunNotifications`): read via `useUiState()`, write via `putUiState()`,
 * reconcile the cache with the server's merged answer on success, toast + refetch on failure.
 * A server truth (not a per-browser cookie) is deliberate here: a promo that is meant to be
 * shown exactly once should not reappear in every new browser, device, or private window.
 *
 * Renders nothing until `uiState` resolves. That, rather than defaulting to visible, is what
 * keeps a returning user (whose dismissal already landed on the server) from ever seeing the
 * banner flash on before the "already dismissed" truth loads — the dismissal itself has no
 * pre-paint requirement (unlike theme/appearance), so there is nothing worth mirroring into
 * localStorage for this one.
 *
 * The copy says WHY to install a repo cezar already clones and merges by default
 * (`DEFAULT_SKILLS_REPOS`): the install is for using the skills OUTSIDE cezar. Inside it, the
 * answer is Skills → Refresh, which this points at rather than duplicating.
