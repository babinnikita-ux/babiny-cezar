/**
 * Server capabilities reported by `/api/health` — the UI hides what the server
 * says isn't there, and the matching endpoints refuse as defense in depth.
 *
 * `localHandoff` (cockpit-ui redesign spec §"Deployment modes — local vs
 * hosted"): the default deployment is `npx cezar-cli` on localhost, where
 * handing a session off to a local terminal/editor makes sense. On a VPS/remote
 * box it doesn't: `CEZ_REMOTE=1` (or binding a non-loopback host) switches to
 * hosted mode — the UI hides every local-machine affordance and the open-in-*
 * endpoints 409.
 *
 * `followups` (spec 007, #444, #471): the global follow-up inbox is **opt-in**
 * via `CEZ_FOLLOWUPS=1` and off by default. Off, agents are never told to write
 * `todos.json` (they get `HANDOFF_ONLY_INSTRUCTIONS` and an empty
 * `CEZ_TODOS_FILE`), the Inbox nav item is gone and the inbox endpoints refuse.
 * The per-task handoff journal is independent and runs either way.
